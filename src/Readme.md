**Movie App with Context API - README**

This Movie App is a simple web application that allows users to browse a collection of movies and view their details. The app is built using React and utilizes the Context API for state management. When a user clicks on a movie, they will get access to the full details of the selected movie.

## Features

1. **Movie Listing:** The app presents users with a list of movies fetched from an external API or a predefined dataset.

2. **Movie Details:** When a user clicks on a movie from the list, they will be able to view the full details of the selected movie.

3. **Context API:** The app uses React's Context API for managing global state, making it easier to share data across components.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code from [GitHub Repo URL](https://github.com/your-username/movie-app-with-context-api).

2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.

3. Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Obtain an API key from a movie database provider (e.g., The Movie Database - TMDb) to fetch movie details. You can sign up for an API key on their website.

2. Create a configuration file (e.g., `config.js`) in the `src` directory and add your API key:

```javascript
// src/config.js
const API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here';
export default API_KEY;
```

3. Start the development server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

4. The app will now be running locally at `http://localhost:3000`. Open your web browser and navigate to this address.

5. Browse the list of movies on the home page. When you click on a movie, you will be redirected to a page displaying its full details.

## Implementation Details

The Movie App is implemented using React with the following directory structure:

```
|-- src/
|   |-- components/
|   |   |-- MovieList.js
|   |   |-- MovieDetails.js
|   |-- context/
|   |   |-- MovieContext.js
|   |-- services/
|   |   |-- movieService.js
|   |-- App.js
|   |-- index.js
|   |-- config.js
```

1. **MovieList.js:** Renders the list of movies and handles the click event when a movie is selected.

2. **MovieDetails.js:** Displays the full details of the selected movie.

3. **MovieContext.js:** Sets up the Context API to manage global state, including the movie data.

4. **movieService.js:** Contains functions to fetch movie data from the external API using the provided API key.

5. **App.js:** The main component that sets up the routing and integrates the context provider.

6. **index.js:** Renders the `App` component and mounts it to the DOM.
